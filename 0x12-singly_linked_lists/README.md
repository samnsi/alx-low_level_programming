Singly linked lists - A singly linked list is a data structure in computer science that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a reference (or "link") to the next node in the sequence. In C programming, a singly linked list can be implemented using a struct that contains a data element and a pointer to the next node in the list. The first node in the list is typically referred to as the "head" of the list, and the last node in the list has a pointer that points to NULL, indicating the end of the list. Linked lists can be useful for implementing dynamic data structures, such as stacks and queues, and they can also be used to implement more complex data structures like trees and graphs.
